Wifi/BT but only because I didn't install a macOS Wifi/BT card yet

# BIOS Settings
You can use the default settings. No change required. Above 4G Decording etc. are all already Enabled.

I also let Fast Boot Enabled, no issues so far.

Only if you need Secure Boot (Enable Secure Boot, Secure Boot Mode to Custom and then in the Key Management all .efi files in your EFI-folder need to be enrolled/whitelisted with "Enroll this EFI").
